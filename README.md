# Programming Hackathon 2024
## Problem Solving and Programming Fundamentals with C

### Problem 1
Event Handlers wants to develop an Employer program to set and retrieve employee ID numbers, employee salaries, and first and last employee names. The current list of employees and their data are as follows:

| Employee Name    | Employee ID | Employee Salary |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Kim Yee           | 101         | $40,000.00      |
| John Reynolds     | 102         | $55,000.00      |
| Elena Gonzales    | 103         | $50,500.00      |
| Jim O’Shea        | 104         | $75,000.00      |

As a programmer, your task is to write a C program to accomplish the tasks given by the specifications

### Problem 2
The Pool Associates operates a business that offers a variety of services to the general public who own swimming pools. Each year, Pool Associates cleans local pools and fills those pools when needed. Because swimming pools require a different amount of time to service, your job is to write a program that calculates the amount of time it will take to fill the pools with water. Then a reasonable estimate of fill-up time can be made before the job begins. This will enable Pool Associates to charge for pool fill-up on the basis of estimated hours. The table below gives some necessary parameters for estimating the fill-up time for a small pool and a large pool. Calculate the fill-up time for a small pool and a large pool. A small pool is considered 20 by 12 by 4 feet, and a large pool 30 by 20 by 10 feet.

| Problem Parameters |                  |
|--------------------:|:-----------------|
| RATE_OF_FLOW        | 50.0 gal/min     |
| CAPACITY            | 7.5 gal/cubic foot|
| L – pool length     |                  |
| W – pool width      |                  |
| D – pool depth      |                  |

### Problem 3
Widget Company runs a small factory that makes several types of nuts and bolts. They employ factory workers
who are paid one of the three hourly rates depending on skill level: (a) RM 7.00, (b) RM 10.00, or (c) RM 12.00.
Each factory worker can work: (a) 40 hours, (b) 45 hours, (c) 50 hours per week. All hours over 40 are paid at
double time.

Jack Smith, the factory manager, wants you to write an interactive C payroll program that will calculate the
gross pay for a factory worker. Hours worked and hourly pay rate to be entered from the keyboard. Once the
figures are entered for an employee, the program prints out: (1) the hours worked, (2) the hourly pay rate, (3)
the regular pay for 40 hours, and (4) the overtime pay.


### Problem 4
Local Caterer’s Company operates a small Mom and Pop catering service. They want you to write a C program
for them to schedule their catering events. They mostly cater special events, but they occasionally cater
corporate, private and non-profit events as well. Mom and Pop are both managers; Mom manages nonprofit
and special events, and Pop manages the corporate and private events. All catered events have an event
minimum rate shown in the table below:

| Event      | Minimum Rate | Manager |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Corporate  | $500.00      | Pop     |
| Private    | $300.00      | Pop     |
| Nonprofit  | $150.00      | Mom     |
| Special    | $200.00      | Mom     |

Write a program for Local Caterer’s Company that accepts keyboard input and checks the event type input for
errors until a valid event type is entered. After a valid input type is entered, print the manager’s name for that
event, the type of event chosen, and the minimum rate to be charged. 


### Problem 5
The Tax Advantage Company provides free tax services to residents who cannot calculate their personal taxes.
You have been asked to write a C program that will calculate an estimated tax for either a single or married
taxpayer, given a keyboard income entry. After the income is entered, a code status “S” for single or “M” for
married is entered. A tax function will calculate the tax based on the input values.
For taxpayers, two tax rates are needed, 15 percent and 30 percent. For single taxpayers, the cutoff rate of 15
percent is $10,000.00, and 30 percent above $10,000.00. For married taxpayers, the cutoff rate is 15 percent
for amounts below $20,000, and 30 percent for amounts of $20,000 and above. Program output should show
the code status, income, and the amount of tax.
